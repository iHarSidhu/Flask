Chapter 3 – Part 2: Practical

What __repr__ Does
In model:
      def __repr__(self):
          return f'<Post {self.title}>'

This method is called:
To Print the object
The object is shown in interactive shell

It appears inside a list

It is for debugging — not database logic.

✅ How to Test __repr__ in Flask Shell
Step 1 — Start in terminal Flask shell
From project root (venv activated):

flask shell
Step 2 — Import model
type this in terminal;
      Flask> from learnFlaskApp.models import Post (enter)
      Flask> from learnFlaskApp import db (enter)

Step 3 — Create a test object (without saving)
      Flask> ? p = Post(title="Shell Test", body="Testing repr function") (enter)

Now type:
      p (enter)
Should see:
      <Post Shell Test>
That means __repr__ worked.

Step 4 — Try printing explicitly
      print(p)
Same output:
      <Post Shell Test>

Nothing is stored in database, only model is created and tested here.
