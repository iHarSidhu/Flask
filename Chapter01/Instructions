01: Understanding Basic Flask Project Structure
learnFlask/
├── learnFlask.py
└── learnFlaskApp/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── routes.py
	

This is called the Application Package Structure.
Instead of putting everything in one file, we split it into modules.

# 01: learnFlaskApp/__init__.py

      from flask import Flask
          
      app = Flask(__name__)
      from learnFlaskApp import routes

What is happening here?
      from flask import Flask

We import the Flask class.
Flask is the main object that creates our web application.

      app = Flask(__name__)

This creates the Flask application instance.
Think of it as: “Create a new website application”

__name__ tells Flask where the application is located.
It helps Flask find: Templates, Static files, Resources

from learnFlaskApp import routes

This line is VERY IMPORTANT.
It imports the routes.py file.

Why?
Because our routes (URLs) are defined inside routes.py.
If we do not import it, Flask will never know those routes exist.

Important:
This import must be at the bottom.
Otherwise, circular import errors may happen.
	
# 02: learnFlaskApp/routes.py

      from learnFlaskApp import app
          
      @app.route('/')
      def index():
          return 'My First Flask Page'

What is happening here?
      from learnFlaskApp import app

We import the app object created in __init__.py.
We need this so we can attach routes to the app.

      @app.route('/')
This is a decorator.
It tells Flask:
“When someone visits the homepage /, run the function below.”
'/' means:
•	Root URL
•	Home page

      def index():
This function runs when someone visits /.

      return 'My First Flask Page'
Flask sends this text as a response to the browser.


# 03: learnFlaskApp/learnFlask.py
      from learnFlaskApp import app

Why does this file exist?
This is the entry point of the application.
	
learnFlask.py
↓
learnFlaskApp/__init__.py
↓
learnFlaskApp/routes.py

Everything gets connected.
